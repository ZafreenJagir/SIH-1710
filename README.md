## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea

Railway stations are large and complex, making it difficult for passengers—especially first-time travelers, elderly people, and persons with disabilities—to locate platforms, restrooms, ticket counters, food courts, and exits.

The proposed solution is a smart indoor navigation system that provides real-time, accurate, and accessible directions within railway stations. The system uses interactive 3D maps, AI-based route optimization, voice guidance, and digital kiosks to help passengers navigate easily.

This solution improves passenger experience, reduces congestion, saves time, and ensures inclusive accessibility for all users.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

The system consists of three main layers:

🔹 User Layer

Mobile Application (Android / iOS)

Digital Kiosks installed inside stations

🔹 Processing Layer

Central Navigation Server

AI Path-finding Engine

Accessibility Rules Engine

🔹 Data Layer

Station Layout Database

Facility & Service Database

Real-time Updates from Station Admin

### Working:
Station Admin updates layouts, facilities, and temporary changes.
Data is stored in the central server.
Users access navigation through mobile app or kiosks.
AI calculates the best route considering congestion and accessibility.
Step-by-step navigation is provided using visual and voice guidance.
